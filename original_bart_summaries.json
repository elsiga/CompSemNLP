{"text": "Obligatory this was when I was in high school. \n\nSo, for those of you who don't know, in Boston there's a shopping area called Haymarket. To all the tourists in the area, it's just Faneuil Hall, which is the crazy cramped food court building in the center of the area.

The people at the counter looked at me and were like, \"Okay, tzatziki aaaaaand?\" And then I cheerfully replied with, \"Oh, and a Nantucket Nectar!\"\n\nThey just looked at me, reached into the display case, and slid the solid near-2 cup tub of tzatziki over to me. I bounced up and down in excitement, gave them some money (and told them to keep the change! I'm a good person!) And bounced upstairs to eat lunch with a spoon. It tasted great, but after like five or more bites it caused that reaction where your body is just like, \"Okay, you need to cool it with that stuff.\"\n\nI proceeded to order tzatziki every time I went to Faneuil Hall for a solid year.

So i go to the healthcare.gov website and apply but because my employer offers coverage i get no discount. I am now officially paying $175 for the worlds worst insurance only to avoid paying premium increase on our house and car insurance as well as the stupid tax for not having any.

It was available at the local Best Buy for $150. Did a quick search and found a printable coupon good for the month of February at Best Buy for 20% off all \"Health & Fitness\" products.\n\nWent in to Best Buy and the price was $160 on the shelf. I found an employee (just happened to be a cute girl) nearby and told her I wanted to get the 305. She said she had that model and loved it...even more than some of the more expensive ones she tried (even though it's huge). She said she has run some marathons and we chatted a little bit about how I was just starting to run. She told me about some of the runs in the area, how the best ones tend to end with beer, and overall was very pleasant and informative while waiting in line at the cashier. I definitely hope to meet more cool people like her while pursuing this sport.\n\nSo I got to the cashier and the 305 rang up at $160 as expected. I mentioned the web site price was $150 and he price matched it. Then I gave him the 20% off coupon and it wouldn't scan. He tried typing in the number and it wouldn't take it. So he tried again and it accepted the coupon, but didn't apply the discount to the 305. He read the coupon, looked at the GPS, manually entered the 20% off and had a supervisor approve it. Super easy, out the door for $120.\n\nThe coupon should work on any \"Garmin Fitness GPS\" (that's an actual category on the Best Buy website), as well as any heart rate monitor or other brand of fitness GPS.\n\nHere's a link to the coupon.

{"text": "Hey everyone. My roommate and I are coming to the end of 2 years of living together. Long story short, I will not continue to live with him beyond 2 years.\n\nWe used to work together and I thought he had his act together. Little did I know it was all a front. He hardly leaves the apartment besides to go to work, never buys household goods, barely cleans up after himself, and definitely doesn't do his fair share of things around the apt.\n\nHe's generally a nice guy but he's completely oblivious and can be really inconsiderate. For example we used to smoke (weed) together from time to time. I am for the most part cool with it. Then it started turning into 12 hour smoke sessions where he would sit in his room all day smoking. I eventually asked him to stop smoking inside, but slowly he started to again. Finally one night, I had had enough and I called him out and he's taken to smoking outside.\n\nSo here's what happened. At the beginning of the month he told me a friend of his needed a place to stay for a few days. I obliged under the agreement that she wouldn't be in the apt all day (I'm working from home and interviewing, speaking on the phone with privileged information, financials, etc.)\n\nHere we are almost two weeks later. She's been here almost every day. The one day she wasn't here, he had his FWB staying the night.\n\nI'm incredibly annoyed at this point. I texted him yesterday (as I knew I wouldn't be home when he was.) Yet he never replied. I texted him again this AM and still crickets.\n\nMy friends say I'm more upset than I should be, but I think my anger is justified. It makes more work for me (constantly emptying the dishwasher, trash I only take out, lack of any kind of alone time in MY own apartment.) I'm not sure what to do at this point.

He hasn't pulled when on the choke chain at all, even when it was first put on apparently, so we think that is what he was trained on (and damage from that process is probably why his barks and whines sound a bit odd). We now think the people who had him before us were violent towards him (if you mime kicking he runs across the room terrified), so, my question is: he is best behaved on walks when wearing a choke chain, and it isn't hurting him at all, but will the harm chokers and the people using them caused him in the past affect him in any way now? I 100% DO NOT want to use a choke chain on him and I don't think anyone should ever, ever train a dog that way, but this chain is the only lead we've used that has completely solved the problem with him pulling, and he hasn't seemed stressed out by it.

He ends up going out to eat way more than he should (his friends all have good paying jobs and don't really care about their health, while he's still looking for a job in his field of study), and is just generally negatively affected by the environment. I like the person he is when we're alone a lot better than him around his guy friends. It seems like he just makes a lot of poor choices around this group. I don't know how to go about telling him this...I know guys can be sensitive when it comes to their friends, though he already knows I don't like his friends. They give me a hard time a lot and tend to make me feel like crap- they've actually reduced me to tears a few times. On that note- they're about 70/30 as far as being jerks goes. Maybe 1/3 of the time they're actually decent to me, but I mostly end up feeling belittled and uncomfortable- it's a lot like High School. I've talked to him about this multiple times, and he says that A) I need to stand up for myself, and B) I need to let him know when I get upset, because he genuinely doesn't know what's making me upset, or what they say that sets me off.

I knew I had little chance with this woman (she's very attractive), but it was worth a shot asking her out for a few dates.\n\nNevertheless, I gathered all the courage in the world, and told her how I felt and if she would give me a chance to go out with her. Her face had the most soul-crushing expression I have ever witnessed. She blankly stared at me, and went away without any explanation at all. I tried contacting her afterwards to apologize if I did something wrong, but she never answered my calls, texts, messages, etc. And everytime I see her (again, we study the same major) she avoids me like the plague.\n\nSo I've been a depressed and confused since that day, wishing never to have said that, among other things. I do miss our friendship a lot. And I thought by trying to forget everything about her and move on would help, but I still see her now and then, wondering why did our friendship end all of a sudden.

{"text": "My boyfriend and I have been together for over two years, and living together since we were together around 6 months. \nEverything was awesome, we rarely fought and there has rarely been any huge issues aside from a few times I've come across him text messaging other women inappropriate things, which he apologized for and I forgave him, etc. (I'm surprised i did, i have serious trust issues)\n\nNow, lately, I've been feeling very upset and frustrated, and generally unhappy.\n\nI feel as though I need to be on my own, I want to travel and explore and do all kinds of things that he's not interested in. I find myself thinking things like \"if I was single I'd go do this\" or \"if I became single again I'd go here or try this\" & I'm realising that if I ever want to do those things, it likely won't be while I'm with him.\n\nBut, here's the hard part - I have no idea if he feels the same way - he knows something is wrong because I've completely shut down over the weekend, my mind is so jumbled and I'm so confused that I didn't eat anything yesterday so I'm obviously not feeling well. Hes been too sweet to me, massaging my back before I fell asleep last night, etc, so I feel like this might completely blindside him.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there's lots about him I love, he's kind (most of the time), he can always make me laugh or smile with his goofy sense of humor, but I really don't know if I csn do this anymore. I feel held back, trapped! I know I could go do all those things with other people while still with him but I fear the rarely seeing eachother due to our schedules would just end in a breakup anyways..\n\nSo what I need is advice - How do I do it?

On top of all this, I've become much more busy, now that I have a \"real\" job and I have an active group of friends.\n\nWhat do I do, folks?  I really don't know where to go from here.

The evidence was falsified to begin with, Jenny McCarthy is an idiot, etc, etc. Vaccines have also, on the whole, been an enormous boon to the health of humanity, saving more lives than anything else ever (probably). The evidence here is overwhelming.\n\nAnd yet, the \"vaccines are good and everyone should them\" mentality is too simplistic. The issue has many angles, and in a community that often engages in exploring and exposing the more hidden side of things I am consistently surprised by the vociferous down-voting and down-shouting of any opinion that questions the aggressive vaccine schedule recommended by the CDC.\n\nThe fact is, every medication--vaccines included--carries a real set of risks. Medications are, or should be, given as the least-bad alternative: the risks associated with giving the medicine are outweighed by the rewards of giving the medicine. Each vaccine has its own risk/reward profile, and for that reason each warrants individual consideration. The CDC has given this consideration to the vaccines that are on (and not on) the recommended schedule, but that doesn't mean all medical professionals are in agreement regarding the schedule or even the need for all vaccines, nor does it mean that all individuals should refrain from individually investigating each vaccine should they so desire.\n\nThere are vested interests in the vaccination schedule, and the CDC is heavily lobbied by the pharmaceutical industry that produces the vaccines we all pay for through our private insurance carriers. This does not necessarily mean that we are having vaccines pushed on us that we don't really need, potentially at risk to our health (however minimal that risk may be), but the incentive is definitely there. Big companies make big money with a more aggressive vaccination schedule. This is as indisputable as is the evidence that vaccines do not cause autism.\n\nSo why not some actual skeptical discussion instead of the blind faith attached to the recommended vaccine schedule? Why not a little more critical thinking and consideration?", "originl_summary": "The \"vaccines are good and everyone should them\" mentality is too simplistic.

Once I got to the Fortaleza airport the flight got delayed a couple of hours but the TAP staff guaranteed us that we wouldn't miss the transfer flight in Lisbon even though it would be a very tight time schedule. Once in Lisbon we (pretty much everyone who was going to Stockholm) ran to the gate just to be denied boarding under the excuse that our luggage wont make it to this flight so we couldn't board, when asked if they could just let us board anyway and then send our luggage the TAP staff girl just said they wont do it. We all went to the transfer desk, pretty upset, only to find a huge line of people from other flights already complaining about their situation. From the 3 attendants in the transfer desk, only 1 was working and the other two just calmly said to us \"We cant help you, you should get in line and wait over there.\" There were pregnant women, people with babies, elderly and everyone stressing out because it has been over 2 hours and the line hasnt move a thing. Soon enough chaos starts and I hear the TAP woman screaming to a customer \"You shut the fuck up! And you too sir!\" (in portuguese). \n\nThats when I pick up my phone and start filming when a lady which was in line with us says: \"You better put that down, you dont have any permission to film here and if you continue, I am allowed to throw your phone away.\" I said it would be illegal of me to publish it but Im filming it to myself and I can do it. She said she was from the press and she knows the law and I cant do that.

For example, she has already started talking about buying a house in the next 1-2 years.

It then dawned on me that I was thinking about my future and if I were to catch my daughter in the act of sex I would probably punch a hole in the wall as to not make a scene...(Obviously kidding but would be really upset non the-less) \n\nNow I'm feeling guilty because if I had a son and I caught him having sex I'd be fine with it, maybe even a little proud. I'm feeling guilty because this is a huge double standard and at my current age, heck even when I was in high school I knew of plenty of girls who were sexually active and didn't see it as a big deal. I know I'm being completely irrational about this seeing as how I don't even have any kids, but I was wondering if anyone had any input on why I was getting so worked up over something that could be 25 years down the line? \n\nI think I'd be fine if I was kind of oblivious to it.. i.e. NOT walking in on my daughter doing cowgirl in my own home.. I'm not a violent person nor would I do anything to this theoretical kid having sexy times with my theoretical daughter, but if I were to see it happen I would just flip..

{"text": "I want to keep this short. Earlier this week my wife of four years decided to tell me she is bi-sexual and is tired of having to suppress her desire to be with a woman. I need to note here that I have never said one way or the other that it is wrong, she just felt like it would upset me. We have had an open conversation about the situation, and out of my trying to respect her and wanting her to be herself I told her that where I was a little uncomfortable with it, if that's what she wanted then I will do my best to be okay with it. \n\nReality is, I am not really okay with the situation. She has offered to include me and the other girl in certain sexual acts which at first sounded like a great thing, but the more I think about it, the more I hate the idea. I have basically become bummed out, feeling that I am no longer enough to satisfy her, and I do not want to have an open relationship or whatever this is considered. The hard part is at the same time I don't want to deny her who she is, or be a dickhead and put some kind of boundary on her. Guess I'm just not sure what to do. Anyways thanks for reading. I know this is a pretty common thing.\n\nThe other biggest and hardest thing about all of this, is my wife has a girl she is interested in already. She was honest about meeting her and everything, and is already arranging to meet up with the other girl. I've read some of the text messages and they are more flirtatious, more loving, and more exciting than anything I ever get from my wife. This is where my heart broke.

Anyway, I went to the pub with a few new friends last night and we all got very drunk and had a good time. We went back to a friends house where I ended up falling asleep. The problem: I went to bed alone (he has a spare bedroom which he let me use because I lived half an hour away from him) but in the middle of the night I woke up being in between two of my male friends. We were fully clothed so I just assumed they would rather share a bed than just sleep on the floor, which didn't bother me, but the friend behind me was touching me in very private places (he didn't go under clothing though). I could hear him whispering things to himself and it was very obvious he was horny. I felt very uncomfortable about this and panicked so I pretended that I was still sleeping. This probably lasted for about an hour and even if I moved to try and get him off of me he would just pull me back.\nWhat I'm asking now is, what do I do?

I am a salary manager in a very popular corporation and he is an hourly manager in another popular franchise. We both make enough money to make ends meet. With my salary I can pay for m half of the bills. He is an hourly manger but is working overtime, so he can make his ends meet as well. \n\nWell, he just put in his 2 weeks notice at his job today because his boss accused him of stealing from him and threaten him of \"breaking his fucking hand\" if he ever stole from him again. My boyfriend on the spot told him he is leaving in 2 weeks. \n\nNow I wouldnt mind so much if we were in a better economic state. I have about 2500 in debt right now and I am now worried about whats going to happen to our apartment. If we cant pay for it, its really going to affect us on our future like our credit score. Also our electricity bills and internet is under our names so that will affect us too. \n\nNow we just got over a heated discussion because he said I wasn't supporting him on his decision. He said, right away I told him he was wrong for leaving the job. That I didnt believe in him cause he kept saying \"things are going to be ok.  I can find another job, its not a big deal\".  \nWe also got in an argument about him thinking his team is going to follow him into whatever new job he has. I told him, in a restaurant youre by yourself, theres no such thing as a team. \n\nMy question is, am I making a mistake by freaking out about whats going to happen? Did I react too harshly to the news?", "originl_summary": "My boyfriend put in his 2 weeks notice at his job because his boss accused him of stealing from him.

Yesterday during marching drill before actual practice began, me and some friends were all sitting outside in the small parking lot we have for band and sports personnel. The lot had been empty up until a few minutes before \"the event\" happened. I never noticed a car had come in, and was talking with a friend. Keeping eye contact and walking backwards at a moderate pace as she followed. Last second she yells \"PintoBean, STOP!\" and I quickly stop, stumble over my foot and fall straight back... into a car. I somehow made a 2 1/2ft wide 1ft tall 1/2in thick dent in the back door of this car (I'm about 5' 10\" and 145lbs). I limp my way inside to get the owner of the car, and he seems fine with it and just wants me to cover insurance/ damages if needed, perfect, no issues, just a small mishap. This was reported to the office as an incident and I'm called in the next morning (day I'm posting) and he's in there, they contact my parents, clear things up, and I give the car owner my parents info to talk about insurance and what to do, the school at this point was just a medium for us to work this out through. So later that day I'm called into the office for the school police officer along with the friend I was talking to. We walk in with the principle I talked with in the morning. We are seated, the officer explains everything, tells us to be calm and we can work this out, average stuff. About near the end of him clearing things up, he breaks part of the news (couldn't tell us everything without the presence of a parent/ guardian) that the owners mom is choosing to go through Juvenile Services and charge me as a criminal instead of just working out insurance.

A lot of our mutual friends know that there's some tension between us, and I've been asked a lot by many people if there's anything going on between us.\n\nI'm relatively attractive, have no problems attracting guys at all, and so is she. It's crazy how much we think alike, and how close we've become without having anything sexual. I'm really confused as to why I'm having all these feelings, and I don't really know what to do. She's the most wonderful person I've ever known, and I have so many conflicting thoughts going on in my head, nothing is clear and I'm completely lost. \n\nWhy do I feel the way I do towards her?

He then left for college again and this is when things started going downhill. I noticed on my brother's girlfriend facebook page a lot of posts from this one guy [lets call him jake].

Please bare with me.\n\nA week ago, I decided to start a (hopefully) lifelong journey to slowly yet steadily improve my life. I bought a scale, and weighed myself at 340lbs. I wasn't nearly as upset as I probably should've been, considering I was expecting closer to 400lbs.\n\nThat very day, I took the first step. I made a myfitnesspal account, and tracked a typical day for me, with no changes. I was very, very quickly disgusted. I discovered two things that fascinated me. The first being, that I DONT over eat. I do however, drink incredible amounts of calories. I found I was drinking TWO THOUSAND calories on a good day. Well, clearly I've established what I need to change most, right? Right.\n\nThe next day, and every day since, I've completely stopped drinking soda, and went into what I believe was a sugar/caffeine withdrawal. Years of drinking hundreds upon hundreds of calories worth of soda has left me more than a little messed up. I allow myself 1 glass of coke a week, and so far this has kept off any cravings, yay! \n\nNow for the advice I need. As I said, I've been tracking my progress with myfitnesspal, hoping to lose 100lbs within a year. Myfitnesspal puts me at approximately 2500cal/day at a loss of 2lbs/week.

It was a silly thing, a small argument that got out of hand because we were long distance and too young to know how to cope with that. I never really got over him, and a few months ago took the step of contacting him again. Since then, we've been talking and getting along very well. So here's the issue...\n\nI am still very much in love with him, and want nothing more than to be with him. He tells me he feels the same, but is unsure about taking it to the next level. We are still long distance (opposite ends of the UK), and I believe that he is scared that the same thing will happen again. I understand this, it was incredibly hard to handle, but we are different people now, more able to handle small disagreements like that. Yes, long distance is taxing, but if it's worth it...\n\nHe also seems to have very set ideas about what I will 'expect' from him. This is very frustrating for me, as these are his ideas and have no bearing on what I would actually need/want in a potential relationship. He seems to misread all my well intentioned conversation as me distrusting him, wanting to know where he is and what he's doing 24 7, when in reality I am simply enquiring about his day. I am merely interested in him, naturally so considering my feelings.\n\nIt is a very difficult situation for us both. But I love him dearly, and want nothing more than a chance to show him that. It causes me great pain that he cannot see this, and I am honestly terrified that he will throw this away rather than risk the hurt.

I've known these two friends since pre-school and they happen to live in my same neighborhood so naturally we talk often and have all grown kind of close over the years. They are twins, so I've usually hung out with both of them together. However, they each have very different personalities and their traits have even grown more distinct throughout high school and I am beginning to absolutely despise one of the twins (I'll refer to her as A).\n\n A has, over the period of about a year, become extrememly moody, aggressive, and exhausting to talk to. Our personalities conflict and we bicker often. I am usually able to laugh it off; she holds grudges. She has started conflicts with me for absolutely no reason and it has progressed to the point where I no longer enjoy being around her and I automatically feel defensive whenever I see her, because of her offensive attitude. \n\nHowever, B & I (the other twin) are the best of friends. Our personalities compliment each other well, and the conflict between A & I has only served to strengthen our friendship. We get along well. I just don't see how I will be able to remain friends with her if I plan to cut A out of my life (even though they \"hate\" each other, they do everything together and have the same mutual friends). It is incredibly frustrasting and I feel I am causing even more conflict between the two of them. For example, A & B give me rides to school (they share a car) sometimes work as well, but after an argument, A told me she would no longer provide transportion for me.

We were friends, she broke up with her fianc\u00e9, needed a place to stay and i offered her my spare bedroom. Granted it wasn't anything more than platonic until about 3 months in. Then it was on and off sex, and I gradually fell for her. Now the ex-fiance never really left the picture, but I didn't understand just how much of an issue it was until now. The only reason I went through her iPad to see the texts (we both have apple products only) was because her ex messaged me on Facebook and sent me some... not very pretty screenshots. However these didn't include a date or anything, so I opted to not believe him. But the seed of doubt was placed and it just grew from there. I honestly thought my girlfriend was only ever talking to me (while we were dating, she said this multiple times). We've only been official for about a month mind you, but I read some stuff that makes me question her feelings for me. Basically she never stopped talking to her ex (even though she claimed otherwise) and was also seeing another guy and telling him that she was \"falling pretty hard for him\". Don't chastise me for going through her texts, I feel like shit for it already. I normally don't do that, but something in my gut just told me to. The worst part is that we have a lease together and theres still about 6 months left. I honestly don't know what to do or feel.

However, she is paying for her college herself, so her plan is to attend community college for a year as a cheaper way to complete some prerequisites.\n\nWhile I absolutely love being with her, and couldn't be happier with our relationship, as seniors I expect the worse come graduation, when we go our separate ways.

One day, probably 8 months ago, his Dad showed me his wife's wedding ring and we talked about their wedding/marriage, etc.\n\nSo I've seen the ring multiple times, I think it's beautiful, and my boyfriend's Dad told him to keep it in his drawer because his Dad is a crazy old man and thinks he will misplace it. My boyfriend had been trying to \"throw me off the scent\" (which I didn't know until later) by saying when he proposes, he's not sure yet if he will use his Mom's ring or a new one. So, naturally, I didn't think it mattered if I saw the ring a few times, or talked about other rings.\n\nI told my best friend about him potentially proposing with his Mom's ring and she thinks it's sweet but that I should have my own since we are \"our own relationship\". I disagree, but she makes an interesting point, so I bring up her point to my boyfriend to get his thoughts (thinking that maybe that's why he is considering using a different ring).\n\nWell shit. My boyfriend gets all upset and says that I wouldn't have brought this new-ring idea to him if I didn't think I should have my own, and that I should know how much the ring means to him and his family, and now half the surprise is ruined because I'll be mad if he gets a new ring (thinking it would be out of spite) but I won't be surprised if I see his mom's ring.\n\nSo, I effectively ruined a future proposal... innocently, but still.", "originl_summary": "My boyfriend's Mom died 4 years ago of cancer, and I never got to meet her.

Our listing agent also made idiotic comments saying \"don't worry the water will just evaporate over night\" when clearly water seeped through the walls and most definitely up the dry wall. She also told my parents that they should just try to hide the damage and hope this wont effect the full offer on the house they accepted the night before the flooding was discovered.

She was released and went home to await her court date.\n\nFlash forward to last month.

{"text": "Fucking webcomics. So I've had episodes before where after I read something, or more rarely though it still happens, if I watch something, I get into a funk/mood. Usually it's a...I hesitate to call it a depression as I feel that that simply makes light of a very serious condition, but at the same time, it's not as far off as I might think. The biggest cause of the mood swing is something that I desperately find to be awesome/cool/amazing/etc. but that either cannot be reality, or that the reality is so far off it might as well not be.\n\nThis time, I was reading a webcomic about a biology grad student accidentally being zapped by a genetics-modification ray, resulting in a six-armed heroine going about being a heroine. Standard stuff, though clich\u00e9d. However this is beside the point. What the point is is that, while I had never really been a fan of the style of comic that this was before, the twist/originality in this one has really struck a chord with me, and has caused a funk.\n\nPart of the reason why I am going to college for what I want is so that I can right what I find wrong with the world, which is not unreasonable, I think. I want to be a Bio-medical Engineer and make cybernetic limbs for amputees (or daring clients), work on BCI's to make this happen, all that good stuff. However, mucking about in genetics is something that also interests me, and creating something akin to the heroine from the comic described above is something that is of great interest to me as well. Well, more specifically, having our understanding of genetics that be great enough to allow for that to happen in the future. But this is a very dangerous proposal as it would undoubtedly be turned into a weapon a la \"supersoldiers\", if it is even possible. Truthfully, I'm thinking it's more of the latter than the former, that the biology/physics involved in making hybrids is so far out of reach that it is not worth doing so for the reasons I would do it, not to even mention the innumerable ethical reasons to not do so.", "originl_summary": "This time, I was reading a webcomic about a biology grad student accidentally being zapped by a genetics-modification ray.

Anyway, I met this girl last summer in South America.  (We are both from the US).  From the second I met her, I immediately thought that I had never seen anyone as gorgeous as she was.  I'll spare you the gooey details, but just assume that I became immediately crazy about her.  We became really close while we were there, but our vacation ended with an abrupt halt after two and a half weeks.  I was madly distraught on the plane flight home, and was a wreck for weeks over how much I missed her, and how sad I was that I never really told her how I felt.

Can I hostel and backpack and train ride through Europe, for instance, without having to pay 200/night for a dog bed? Will I totally destroy a dog's sense of security by not giving it a steady home? \n\nThat said, I haven't PLANNED a huge backwoods excursion yet, but I want to, and likely will, and think that should factor into my adoption decision.

Not the other way around. This was a job opportunity trip that helped me in my field of profession. I didn't cheat on him nor did I talk/sleep with someone after the break up.

They proceed to tell my BF, in front of me, that he should dump me, asked him why he was with me, told him I was a bitch and that I'll probably leave again. The straw that broke the camel's back for me was when one of them stated \"Well, at least she lost some weight while she was gone.\" \n\nMy guy, though definitely uncomfortable with the situation, failed to say anything or stick up for me.

My little sister has ALWAYS fought people when they bring up her body odor, we've even brought her to a doctor once after we made her shower for a full week in a row to see if the smell will disappear - but it didn't, it actually got 10x worse. The doctor said the smell seemed more with her care of her body and surroundings than anything else, so that was that. After that, every time ANYONE brought up the hygiene issue, she would not make any excuses, she would actually do the total opposite - she becomes verbally abusive, result to names and then make it almost intolerable to talk to her.\n\nCut to two weeks ago, her friend had brought her home from school and I admit, her odor was fairly strong that day. My sister didn't see it, but her friend hosed her car with febreeze and rolled her windows down before pulling away. I didn't tell her, but I sure did bring her odor up again and was met with, again, verbally abusive language and behavior. \n\nAnother incident that happened is my sister went to use the bathroom on a following day while I had friends over. Her scent was SO OVERPOWERING that when my friend went in, he immediately came out and he had a visibly disturbed look on his face. He, having been my friend since elementary school, was honest with me and told me he smelled some really bad in our bathroom. I checked, it was indeed my sister's odor as it tends to linger. \n\nTHEN another incident where we went to the store, she was elsewhere in the establishment and I was in one aisle with another woman, who was 100% perfectly fine...until my sister showed up. She visibly looked uncomfortable and ended the conversation VERY quickly the second my sister arrived and stuck around for at least 15 seconds.

Talked to my CC company and they said nothing they can do until it either posts or goes away.  A week later, the charge finally disappears --- I decided to cancel the account anyway just in case.  No harm done.\n\nFlash forward to today - received a voicemail from a computer company I've never purchased anything from asking if I would like to reorder my attempted order from April (which evidently did not go through because of a 'credit card issue').  Clearly another charge that isn't mine which probably came right as I canceled my original card, or there abouts. \n\nBut they left a reference number for the order in the voicemail so I figured I would follow up.  I wound up getting all the info off of the account -- it included my name, home billing address, phone number and my (now canceled) credit card info.  It also included a shipping address (which is presumably the home address of the fraudster) on the other side of the US.\n\nSo now I have this info but I have no idea what I can/should do with it.  My bank doesn't seem to be that interested because no charge was ever made on my account (though they said even if one was it probably wouldn't change anything) and I live in a huge city far, far away from where the person possibly lives so I doubt getting in touch with my local PD would matter or if they would even care (and like I said, not even sure a crime was committed -- though someone clearly intended to at least try).\n\nAny thoughts?  I have no interest in \"tracking the person down\" or anything like that though would like to try to make sure they can't keep getting away with this.

Harvey said I can come skate one day with a smaller group a friends another day. I didn't ask any questions, and just said okay. It really hurt my feelings at the time, but I'm over it now. This was a week ago\n\nHarvey came into my store yesterday, and apologized for what happened. He felt really bad. Apparently the day they went to go skate, Jessica just talked shit about me the whole time, even though I've never even met her. Whatever, right? \n\nBut then Harvey told me that Jessica was talking about hanging out with my boyfriend recently. My stomach dropped. I didn't want to seem caught off guard so I didn't ask any questions. \n\nI'm not a psycho controlling bitch. If he would have just told me, I wouldn't have minded. Now it seems really sketchy that he's hanging out with her without without telling me. I don't think he would cheat on me, but I still feel uneasy about all this and don't know how to confront him.\n\nI'm mostly posting here because I'm not sure how to confront him.

Not only does she feel it may not be possible to live with HB because of this, she also feels a need to confront HB about his attitudes towards gays because she doesn't want to betray our gay family member.\n\nMy advice to her at the moment is to talk to him about the gay issue, instead of confronting his entire worldview.

I make a decent amount of money at my job; enough that after a couple years of living at my parents' I was able to but myself a house and a nice car.  \n\nSo a few days ago a friend asks if I want to see a movie tonight with him and another friend.  They both work at the theater and are able to get a guest in free.  So I'm assuming I'll be going for free.  Today I ask him about it and tells me that he invited another friend and her boyfriend (and claims he invited them first) so they get the free tickets.  Mind you I don't think he even asked our other friend if it was cool if they used his guest pass.\n\nThis kind of bugged me so I said something to him about and he responds with something along the lines of \"well they probably won't go if they can't get in free.  No offense, but they don't have a lot of money and I feel like you can afford it.\"  He also said something about how he wouldn't be going either if he didn't work there because he doesn't have any money either.  I won't even get into that one, but let's just say he has another job as well and the only reason he's broke is because he spends frivolously on stupid shit.  I kind of just let it go after that.\n\nIt is true that I have more money than the rest of them, but between college loans, car payments, and a mortgage, I'm probably more in debt than the 4 of them combined.  \n\nTo me it would make more sense if we all (or at least the 3 guests) to split the cost of one ticket... The funny thing is that if I had been offered the guest pass I probably would have offered it to one of the other two anyway.  So maybe it's just an ego thing and I feel slighted. \n\nSo what is it Reddit?  Am I greedy?  An Egomaniac?

We danced (near each other, not with each other *awk me*), talked a lot, shared some laughs, and generally got to know each other. Peachy. So when I dropped her off, the awkward hit like a sack of bricks in the face. I suddenly got nerved up and I think I came across as just...completely uninterested. So parting ways I think I said something ambiguous and unromantic like \"See you around\". There was this instant wipe of disappointment and then she said \"Can I at least get a hug?\" and I happily obliged but...it kind of threw off my entire view of the night. I mean I am so afraid of being too fast or rushing into anything...but of course I wouldn't mind something a little more romantic myself.

Unfortunately, I made the great mistake of forgetting that there was a line in my lease that states it automatically renews unless I tell my landlord 60 days in advance that I will not be renewing. Instead I told him 45 days in advance. I was then told I am on the hook for another 12 months with an increase in rent (850) unless another person takes the lease.\n\n On the positive side, the real estate agency that works for my landlord is attempting to find a leaser now, but since the landlord wants 850 for the lease, it is proving a challenge for the agent to find someone. In the meantime, I've found a cheaper apartment including utilities down the street and already put a deposit down (685 for deposit + 345 for half month of rent). It should be noted that my current apartment is extremely expensive because of the inefficient heating (160/month in winter) and it's in a rundown old building.\n\nMy question is that if a person cannot be found for my current lease, does it make sense to lose my deposit at the other apartment complex and just stay at my current apartment? Or should I gamble that someone will be found by the agent in the next two weeks? Or should I pay a month of double rent in the hopes that someone takes the lease by the end of July.

It was about 1 am on a weekday so they couldn't have been spotted by the boat. They all start whacking balls out towards the boat with no avail but eventually he said that he layed one out with a 3 wood and knew that he had hit the boat.

{"text": "Ok Reddit; You seem to know way more about science than me and I trust that a lot of you can answer this question to your own satisfaction but you may not manage to educate me if you assume that I have the same scientific education as you. My formal science education stopped 11 years ago when I was 16 years old. Since then it has been what I happened across and conversations with scientists. (I love learning through conversations). Please go slow explaining this...\n\nHere's my understanding of the principles of evolution theory;\n\nIf you live to make babies who live, well done your genes are passed on. If you don't, sad times mr, your genes are no longer contributing anything.\n\nIf a certain gene gives you an advantage over your competitors for a mate or for a dwelling or for surviving a winter etc then they will help you to survive and make a baby or two. This way the genes that are helpful slowly are preserved whilst the genes which do not help or even hinder slowly get weeded out. It's good it's logical and I'm happy. Until...\n\nI'm considering the final stages of human evolution; At some point we got quite ahead of the curve. We're much more intelligent and adaptable than our closest evolutionary relative right? We have developed technology like weapons and clothes. We can adapt much better. So at some point our competition stopped being with the other species I think and was only down to who got to sleep with yonder hottie and who survived that snow storm last winter. Perhaps it was also to do with fights over who get's to sleep in this part of the valley.\n\nMy point is. There's a huge amount of lovely inhabitable fertile world out there. Once we beat the apes even by 25% of the advantage we have over them now, why did we continue to evolve so far in advance of them? Our competition with fellow humans is surely not fierce enough? Only now are we really in a place where the population is unsustainable. Why would we have evolved before now?\n\nI apologise if this is long and meandering.

{"text": "So a little back story. I met my boyfriend about 9 and a half months ago. We started hanging out and sleeping together pretty frequently and within a month we were exclusive. Things moved pretty fast after that. We've moved in together, bought furniture and televisions and a car together. \n\nHe has had issues with anxiety and depression. He also has a condition that causes physical pain in his legs, ankles and feet.\n\nWe've only had a few issues during our relationship. There's been no cheating, no lying that I know of, nothing to have caused things to go wrong. However it still feels like things are going wrong.\n\nUntil about a month ago we were having sex every day. We experimented and tried new things. He performed oral sex on me at least twice a week. It was great. So when the sex started getting less frequent, I talked to him about it. At first he told me I was crazy and I was imagining it so I gave it time. After a week or so though nothing changed. I talked to him about it again and this time he blamed it on his depression, poor self image and his leg pain. I now get sex once a week if I'm lucky and if we have sex, I'm always on top.\n\nSo on top of not having sex, we don't do anything except sit around, watch Netflix and maybe get high. We never go on dates or take walks or cook together and we rarely talk unless we're outside smoking a cigarette. \n\nOn top of that he is constantly getting annoyed with things I do. Even things that he used to find endearing. He makes me feel like I'm an idiot. \n\nSo basically I'm wondering if this kind of change in a relationship is normal. I've only been with 2 guys exclusively before this one and they were both cheaters and liars and had no respect for me so I'm afraid my idea of normal is not in fact normal.

There was no one sleeping on bottom, I just liked sleeping up there.  In any case, when I was in high school, long after I'd moved on from masturbating in bed, I noticed some stains on the wall when I was in the bottom bunk reading.  It looked like someone had dribbled coke or something on the wall and the syrup had dried into these little browning streaks.  I couldn't see their origins, but it was clear they'd come from above.  I investigated and found several impact sites, unmistakably wrought by my pubescent self-exploration.\n\nI freaked out a little and tried scrubbing them off, but when that didn't work I realized that it probably wouldn't ever matter; no one ever had any reason to get close enough to this wall in my room to notice and I doubted my family would ever have a need to move the bed, thereby discovering my embarrassing secret.  I turned out to be wrong about that too.\n\nI'm at college now, and my mom recently informed me they're redoing the carpet in my old room this summer.

{"text": "Hi all,\n\nFirst time caller, long time listener here. I bought a steak yesterday as part of my New Years resolution to learn more about cooking. Now, I know there are a hundred posts on here about how to cook a steak. The searing, the flipping, the finishing off in the oven, etc. I've read through a lot of them, however I've decided it to be a better idea for me to reach out for some more specific advice. \n\nI plan on cooking the steak this evening. It's a beautifully marbled 1.25\" - 1.5\" cut of boneless ribeye. I don't believe it was dry-aged. I was planning on going out this morning to purchase a Lodge 12\" Cast Iron Skillet to cook in seeing as they are pre-seasoned, but after a bit of research, it seems only right to re-season the pan. The problem with this is that the process would take hours and I may not have that kind of time. My other option is a run-of-the-mill 12\" frying pan with a plastic handle, which leaves the option of finishing the steak off in the oven out unless I want melted cookware.\n\nAs for the rest of the process, I plan on letting the steak come to room temp for about 40 - 60 min before salting and I've decided on salting immediately before searing. As far as the sear goes, I have vegetable oil and I have unsealed butter. I like the idea of cooking the steak in oil and finishing it off in butter a la Chef Ramsey, although I'm still up in the air on the flipping method. To flip once or constantly, that is the question! After much research and it being my first time with such a nice cut of meat, I'm leaning more towards the flip every 15 - 20 secs as opposed to 1 flip. The reason is that since I'm unfamiliar with cooking a steak of this proportion, I will be better able to gauge cook time and achieve a more even sear, since I'm not positive on how long to cook on each side with the one flip method.\n\nSo fellow redditors, what advice do you have for me? Any and all is welcomed. Thanks!", "originl_summary": "I bought a steak yesterday as part of my New Years resolution to learn more about cooking.

{"text": "Hey Reddit, since you guys were pretty helpful last time I asked for relationship advice I'm hoping that can be the case this time too. So I've been dating my current girlfriend since this past August and things have been great. I've actually known her for 3 years but when we tried dating when I was 17 and she was 20, her mom was having none of that so obviously things didn't last very long. So, 3 years later and we're trying again, this time with her mother's approval and her father's approval, or so we thought. Last night my girlfriend's dad gave her a long winded conversation of basically why he doesn't like me, how apparently he thinks I'm not going anywhere in life (to be fair I'm only a student in my 2nd year of Architecture technology, not sure where he got that idea from), he also said I don't talk to him enough when he's never really tried to make conversation with me and says I don't look him in the eye which I have, not sure where that's coming from either, point is he doesn't like me. She mostly thinks it has to due with him being raised by an abusive father, for he kept saying to her well I would never bring a girl to my house when I was your age, which my girlfriend said to me she wouldn't have either if she lived in that house. On a side, my girlfriend has cerebrallypalsy affecting the right side of her brain but its an extremely mild case. The only things she can't really do is drive and cut her own food and other two handed tasks that most people take for granted. So I guess because of this her parents are a little bit more protective.

While I have no issues with him watching porn, it makes me uncomfortable at the thought of him going to a strip club. I have gone to a SC a few times, and each time I was danced upon and so were the men in my group. This makes me uncomfortable. \n\nMy bf is going for a bachelor party, and he hasn't seen this friend for a couple years. I told him that I was uncomfortable with him going but that I was not going to stop him if he wanted to go. \n\nThe party is this Friday. \n\nTo complicate things further (in my mind), is the fact that we have been having an issue in the bedroom lately. Mainly, my libido is higher than his, and he has turned down sex twice in the last two weeks. We have sex a decent amount, but he initiates less and less and it makes me feel unattractive. Last night I initiated sex, and when I went down on him he went completely \"dead fish\" on me. When I asked him what was wrong he said he was \"hoping to get into it, but that he wasn't into it yet.\" This was after I had been rubbing and teasing him for almost 15 minutes and been sucking him off for a couple of minutes. \n\nWe have talked about our difference in sex drives a couple of times, and he swears to me that he is \"insanely attracted\" to me and that he just \"doesn't want sex all the time.\" (He has had two LTR, and in both sex dwindled to about once a month by the end of it.) \n\nSo, I guess I am just trying to reconcile him wanting to go to a strip club and see other naked women when he doesn't want to pay attention to the one he has at home.

If that didn't make me mad enough, for my birthday shortly after, we usually exchange really awesome and thoughtful gifts since our birthdays are around the same time. I got her concert tickets to my favorite band and she got me 20 dollars and a card. I felt extremely embarrassed and sad that she seemed to not put any thought at all.

So naturally, as any people of that age do, we drank (legal age in Canada is 19) and smoked weed and held awesome parties way on the other side of the campground to avoid annoying the other campers. Now my last year of camping at this lake we had a nice party one night lots of people some familiar faces, some new. The next day the administrator of the campground informs my site mates and I that we are banned from the campground for 5 years for giving alcohol to minors. What really happened is irresponsible parents lost track of where their kids were, and also track of where their booze were (the 15 and 16 year olds, who were not invited, obviously stole their parents alcohol). I know I didn't give any alcohol to any of the young people, and I'm sure my friends wouldn't have (we worked our asses off at near minimum wage that summer just to save up enough to go camping, we had no extra drinks.)

We've had a pretty hefty share of hardships, but we've fought through and we're a stronger couple than ever. He is in every way my perfect complement, and vice versa. He treats me with respect, is always honest with me, and more supportive and patient than anyone I've ever met. We work so well together.\n\nThe problems come in with our plans for the future. I am going into my last semester of college. He's been out for a few years, and is going to be going to grad school next spring for a master's in video game design. I think it's awesome, and I think he'll be amazing at it, but I know that will require a lot of moving for at least the first 5-10 year chunk of his career. This doesn't fit too well with my dream, which is to open up my own photography studio and be a small business owner. Picking up and moving every 2 years doesn't really suit that.\n\nThe bigger issue is this: He has absolutely zero interest in having children. None whatsoever. I have never even considered NOT having children until he came along. I keep trying to tell myself that I can manage without them, that I can find work/volunteer work with children, and still find fulfillment there. But...I really don't know if that's true.\n\nMy response to this would probably just be to wait it out, enjoy my time with him, and see where our lives take us.

Plus he invited me to his brother's wedding and asked me to go away for the weekend with him, among other very coupley things.

I don't want to let him go though, because he gives me everything I need (beside the title of girlfriend) and I'm scared I won't find another guy as nice as him. I've been with quite a few dudes, and at this point in the relationship they usually fade on me or start to treat me like shit. \n\nI'm just not sure if I should let him go because we want different things at the moment, or if I should stick it out for a little while longer and see if he changes his mind, since it genuinely feels as if he really likes me.

But I can't just eat healthy food every day without a single bit of sugar. So I go to a fast food place once a month to get my fix. I usually eat it at home in the comfort of my computer playing games till my parents get home, but if they found out they would probably beat me for this. So I got a bright idea to burn the paper bag and wrapper that it comes in and carefully collect those ashes and throw it outside.\n\nI do this once a month and throw the ashes over some little flowers in my backyard. I do this steadily for a few months and nothing goes wrong. Well one day at school we have to take home this fish once a week or so to collect data on its habits. Well I take a fish home every week and then I always take it back to school the next day at 5 in the morning. Well my neighbors see me come home sometimes because they're this amazing old couple who just sits and watches the outdoors together and they probably see me come home with a fish every week or so.\n\nSo every week I take home a fish but since I leave so early they never see the fish leave my house. Then they see me in the afternoons after I come home go outside and spread some ashes over some flowers because in my mind I think ashes are good for plants so I do that, but this old couple thought I was cremating my dead fish and tossing their ashes once a month.\n\nBeing the amazingly nice people they are, after last weeks burning of evidence, they stop by and they're carrying a little fish tank with this beta fish in it and when I open the door they say they saw me spreading the ashes of my fish and hoped this fish would outlive the rest and then they said goodbye and left me there kinda shocked at what just happened.

My father, while incredibly successful and a great provider, has always been emotionally abusive to my mother.

For example, my father is an incredibly reckless driver. Whenever my mother comments on something he did that was unsafe, it turns into 2 hours of him screaming at her for constantly criticizing him. He also screams at me and my siblings about mundane things e.g. not cleaning something properly, dropping something, not using utensils correctly (?? who knows).\n\nI'm at a loss at what to do. I absolutely adore my mother and my father is enjoyable to be around when he is not angry, but I'm tired of seeing her screamed at by him.

However, my mother consistently tells me that he wasn't like this when she married him and if she had known how he would turn out, she wouldn't have.\n\nI've already told her that when I have children I will be extremely hesitant to leave them alone with my parents.

{"text": "So, me and my buddies are walking around town looking for some dinner. We see a nice looking burger joint across the street and decide we want some of that greasy meat. Looking over the menu, I see a burger called The Juicy Lucy; a half pound of 100% beef stuffed with american cheese. I couldn't find any reason why that wouldn't be anything but fucking delicious, so I spend 7 bucks and get myself a Juicy Lucy.

I told him I got a Juicy Lucy, he smiled and said, \"Oh, well that takes longer.\" Right, got it. So finally Lucy comes out and she looks absolutely scrumptious, dripping with grease and bulbous as all hell. I look at this monster and think, 'Wow, thats a lot of cheese and meat in there'. This is where I went wrong, see it wasn't just cheese and meat in there. I raise the burger to my mouth, and as I bite into it the punchline to the greatest pussy joke ever is revealed. Turns out Lucy is a squirter, because as soon as my teeth sunk into the patty, grease exploded out of the burger with ferocious velocity. At least an ounce or two of pure beef grease squirts directly into my eyes, all over my face, onto the table. Not only am I covered in grease but I just spent $8 on this shit.

That night went fantastic, we hit it off immediately, got a kiss goodnight, everything was looking up. We go on a few dates, walk in the park, dinner and a movie, etc and things continue to look up. The one problem we continued to have was not really communicating, we would not talk/sparsely talk for a week or more between dates, it seemed like we just didn't have a lot to talk about. We had sex, the sex was great, we both left extremely satisfied. But despite that, and the fun we had on dates, we continued to not really talk. Both of us, realizing this was strange, apologized for the lack communication and promised to improve. Yet we still kind of drifted apart I guess, meanwhile we still meet to have sex. I'm not sure who's fault it was really that we didn't talk as much as we should, probably mine regardless. So I broke it off,  so to speak, because I felt like we were both putting on a facade as far as the relationship side of things goes and I offered to continue our friendship. She was relieved to hear all of this as she was feeling the same way but she requested that we still be available to one another sexually if either of us was getting horny or whatever. We had an awesome productive conversation about it and agreed to be FWB for the time being. Fast forward a month and we have continued having sex once a week or so. Sex continues to be good. I know very well that she is not interested in more than a FWB relationship, and I remember a time very clearly when I honestly felt nothing toward her romantically but despite the logical side of my thinking telling me to move on, I feel an aching love-sickness especially now as her Ex is in town.

After fall quarter, I'll be on academic probation for the second time under the school of biology. A part of me is really hard-headed and doesn't want to admit that due to my past disregard for my academics, I can no longer achieve a competitive GPA unless I buckle down and shut out the world for the next 3 years. Realistically, I don't think that's going to happen. Though I have some interest in bio, I have no passion for it.\n\nMy parents keep on telling me it's do-able with hard work, and they've been such a big source of support and motivation, but other than them, I have no motivation for staying in bio. My parents always tell me that while I have the oppurtunity, I should aim for the highest possible accomplishments since I'm attending a good university, and I agree with them. But I don't know if I should aim for that under bio. They really want me to stay and become involved in the medical field since \"that's where the money is.\" I don't argue with them about that point since I know how important money is to support a family, but I know that I'm not fit for the medical field. \n\nWhat I've always really wanted, but locked away because I knew it is impractical, was to become a teacher.

I'm contemplating switching into philosophy or something in humanities. I know that I'll definitely be happier if I do, and I see myself achieving more in that field versus science.

She has gotten worse and worse over the last year, and currently makes him do all the household work (cleaning, cooking, fixing things, snow removal, dishes, laundry, etc).  I just found out last night that she is now quitting her job with no prospects for a new one.  He works full time, somewhat manual labor, in a high stress position.  The job she left was at a bookstore, and she quit because it was too hard and she \"didn't like it\".  She also has a new (gas guzzling) car that they make payments on, while he drives an old beater because they cannot afford anything more.  She is constantly telling him he can't buy things like a certain grocery item he wants because it's \"too expensive\", while she goes and buys designer clothing at the mall often.  The worst part is that she is a massive \"feminist\" (read: hypocrite) and feels as if she is entitled to an easy life and should be taken care of.  She also treats him like shit on a daily basis and is not afraid to order him around and berate him, even right in front of me.  The final straws for me have been his recent need to start taking anti-depression meds, and her deciding to quit her job.  He is absolutely blind to how bad the situation is (or possibly in denial), and anytime I mention something about it, he gets very defensive and sticks up for everything she does.

In the past I've had a series of girlfriends that I haven't particularly loved. I always thought that my problem was that being a nerdy guy, I just liked having someone show interest in me.

You never know someone until they fall in love with you.\n\nWhere does this leave me? I can label myself as an asshole, or at the very least as someone who really shouldn't be going out with people until I can sort this out now that I'm aware of it. So I'm not interested in hearing how I'm an asshole. Where else does it leave me? It leaves me in long term relationships with lovely girls, but I have no idea what it's like to properly love someone of my own accord. Or perhaps I should say to love someone on their own accord. So it doesn't exactly leave me in a good spot either.\n\nDoes anyone have any insight? Why I might be like this, what I can do. Every girl I've been with has absolutely loved me, and I have been a very good boyfriend because that's what I love to do, so it's not like the relationships are any different for this.

It had been a year since her last appointment because my family and I decided to groom her ourselves. She was happy and excited when we got there and pee'd a little when the groomer examined her. When we came back to pick her up, the groomer said that was aggressive all throughout and tried to bite her several times. They eventually put a dog muzzle on her. My mom and I were so surprised by this because she has NEVER showed any aggression towards a human or towards any of her previous groomers. In fact, she loves being cuddled by other people and goes to people whenever we're at a dog park. \n\nWhat do you guys think went wrong and what could I do for the next appointment?\nAt first I thought it was because of her matted fur.

I've brought that up to her but she says she will only keep drinking when she wants to. When she would instagram pictures of them together hanging at the club or wherever it made me feel uneasy. I felt it was unhealthy to feel that way and getting addicted to seeing what she would post so I stopped going on instagram completely. \n\nThe reason why I get jealous is because I feel like she has more fun when it's just him and her vs me and her since he makes her laugh so much.

She did not really like her job that much (under payed) and I had a hard time finding a job on her side of the state (2 hours away). \n\nShe expressed a feeling of not knowing what she wanted to do with her career, leading her to not be able to commit looking for work near me. She was always really nervous with decisions and really feared drastic change. So I didn't push her, even though the distance was getting too both of us. She has to do whats best for her.\n\nSuddenly, that excuse ended up ending the relationship. She acted distant randomly as I visited her for the week (this was later in the week) and I called her out on it. She told me she doesn't know what she wants for her life and wants to be alone at this point in her life. She told me she loved me and as I left her house, I told her I hope shes finds what makes her happy and that I loved her. We were both in tears as I walked down her porch.\n\nIt has been a week since then and I am up-and-down each day. Happy,Sad,Confident, Self-loathing, miserable, ecstatic and most of all confused. I do still love her and I really don't know how to analyze what I am feeling. The breakup was out of nowhere.

{"text": "I am in a rut. My family decided to go Chengdu recently but threw all the planning matters to me, and I am in a lost of what is Chengdu like other than hotter than sin hotpots and an other worldly location in Jiuzhaigou.\n\nHere's the plan:\n3 days Chengdu. No idea what locations to visit. I browse thru sites at Tripadvisor. Personally I think I will choose Jinli, Hakka Village. Somewhere unique but not too \"fake\". My parents unfortunately has a rather bad experience in Kyoto and they would like it if its not full of \"UNESCO\" heritage stuff but scenery is way too manufactured (I know, quite a controversial opinion but it makes my dad refuses to go to Tokyo this year even if he never been there). And some nice food. My dad's quite picky and quite unpredictable with food taste but he does like non-oily food. He is quite contradictory when it comes to oily food.\n\nThere is a talk of going Hailuogou. We have never been in a glacier and in short term are not likely to go to anything similar but our aunt recommend us to go there. Personally it sounds great to me.\n\n3 days JiuZhaiGou - We are not going to Huanglong or WenChuan (we really dont want to), but straight away to JiuzhaiGou by flight. Will it be feasible to go in 3 days? What are the things I should take care of? By the way Jiuzhaigu is a compulsory for the trip.\n\n2 days Chengdu.If we are going Hailuogou then we will go to the places mentioned above.\n\nAll of my family speak Chinese so languages shouldn't be a concern. Should we get a guide in Chengdu/hailuogou or Jiuzhaigou? My dad is disabled so he's our primary concern. He is perfectly willing to shell out money for transport/stay in hotel if the place is too dangerous, but we will like it if he can participate with us if not all of the time.", "originl_summary": "My family decided to go Chengdu recently but threw all the planning matters to me.

{"text": "We've been together about a year but have been friends for 7 years. \n\nI had gotten out of an emotionally abusive relationship with a man who was severely mentally ill (delusional, heard voices, manic depression and so on) before I started dating my current bf, I'll call him Adam.\n\nI loved because he was sweet, caring, didn't have a quick temper, treated me with respect and so on. It was much different from my last relationship. Adam also had a good job, master's degree and took care of himself.  Ambition and handsome, the whole package\n\nWell the industry hes worked in for the last 8 years and has his master's in has taken a sever down turn. His friends are all being laid off, including him. There's little to no jobs available and he's been unemployed for 4 months. \n\nHe no longer works out. He's almost completely stopped walking his dog. I do it when I get off work (he usually comes with, but I need to make the suggestion) and we hardly communicate now. \n\nHe also suffered a knee injury from work which makes excersing difficult. Which wad one of his favorite things and we often enjoyed running together. \n\nI told him recently I need more intimacy and our lack of communication has been making me very unhappy. He apologized and is trying but I feel awful that he things he needs to force a smile around me. I feel guilty for feeling liked this because I'm not trying to make his problems about me, but I don't know how to be supportive anymore. \n\nI loved him for his sense of humor and ambition (among other things) but they've both almost disappeared. After dealing with someone depressed for so long in my last relationship I find it exhausting trying to maintain my current one. \n\nHe feels like his body is broken and that he's wasted his life on a degree that's now pointless.

My mom passed away almost two years ago and it's just been Dad and I since then.\n\nI'm working on getting out of the house soon but due to issues on both sides I've remained at home the past two years.

I know she would want dad to be happy and find someone else but I'm not ready for the change.

I've been learning new things about him, things I somehow didn't know the first time we dated.\n\nA few hours ago though, I watched his snapchat story and it was a picture of him kissing this cute guy on the cheek with the caption \"best date of my life\".\nI just feel empty. I didn't realize how much I liked him until I saw him with another guy. I feel so worthless. I want to cry but I can't for some reason.\nThis whole time he was over me and I thought I was too but I don't think I ever dealt with it. And now all I can think about is what might have been and how much time I've wasted on a guy who seemingly doesn't care about me.\n\nThis keeps happening to me.

I told her it was a bad idea and she should just stay and get a place with me like we talked about before. She then told me I was a bad friend for trying to keep her from pursuing her BF. We stopped talking, she dropped all contact with me and that was it. \n\nTime went on; I went through my old high school things at my parent's place and got a bit emotional looking at old photos of the two of us with our other friends. \n\nOne thing led to another and I tracked her down on facebook. From the look of it she still lives overseas and is now married. \n\nI'm at a cross roads now about contacting her.
