# DPO the model
Run FinalTrainer.ipynb (you will need a wandb account)
# Compare performance
Open ModelSummaries.ipynb after running the FinalTrainer with the model you want, then generate the summaries, for the DPO model and the base model. Then compare the quality with the original model, don't forget to change the original model name to the model you finetune, we used bart-large-cnn.
